/// The CoW column combinator — where conditional copyability enters the tower (the ratified
/// W4 design, `PROPOSAL-tower-perfected-design.md` §1.3 / R-1 / R-2).
///
/// `Shared` wraps a MOVE-ONLY buffer column in a refcounted box and is `Copyable` exactly when
/// the ELEMENT is copyable: copies share the box until the first mutation restores uniqueness
/// (`ensureUnique()`); `~Copyable`-element instantiations are move-only and statically unique
/// (no CoW surface exists for them at all). Copyability flows from the COLUMN:
/// `Array<Shared<E, …Linear>>` is the value-semantic column, `Array<…Linear>` stays the
/// zero-cost move-only column.
///
/// ## The SE-0427-forced spelling
///
/// Conditional `Copyable` may not depend on `B.Element` ("conditional conformance to
/// suppressible protocol 'Copyable' cannot depend on 'B.Element: Copyable'"), so the element is
/// a DIRECT generic parameter welded to the buffer's element — and that direct parameter is
/// also what makes `Shared` the ELEMENT-KEYED CONFORMANCE CARRIER (`Equatable`/`Hashable`/…):
/// the semantics the phantom buffers faked through `S.Element` re-materialize here, where the
/// element type is genuinely first-class.
///
/// ## Teardown (the drain-box rule, R-5)
///
/// The box's class `deinit` OWNS element teardown (it drains the buffer through public mutating
/// API, closed with `_fixLifetime(self)` — the stdlib `_ContiguousArrayStorage` idiom). Never
/// rely on a struct deinit running behind a class hop: under `-O` +
/// `isKnownUniquelyReferenced`, the devirtualized destroy of a generic-namespace-nested
/// `~Copyable` struct OMITS the user deinit (the durable repro:
/// `swift-institute/Experiments/cow-box-deinit-omission-miscompile`). With the drain, the
/// storage oracle behind the box tears down an EMPTY buffer — correct whether or not it runs.
